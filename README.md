Phantom
=======

Phantom is a high performance proxy for accessing distributed services. It is an RPC system with support for different 
transports and protocols. Phantom is inspired by Twitter Finagle clients and builds on the capabilities of technologies like 
Netty, Unix Domain Sockets, Netflix Hystrix and Spring. Phantom proxies have been used to serve hundreds of millions 
of API calls in production deployments at Flipkart.

## Changelog

Changelog can be viewed in CHANGELOG.md file (https://github.com/Flipkart/phantom/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Why Phantom
Phantom is the "ghost who walks" - an entity whose presence can be felt (in a good way) but its existence need not be acknowledged.
The Service Proxies fit this analogy well and therefore earned the moniker "Phantom". Motivation for creating Phantom and design overview 
is described in this [Proxies for resilience and fault tolerance in SOA](http://tech-blog.flipkart.net/2013/07/proxies-for-resilience-and-fault-tolerance-in-distributed-soa) blog post.
